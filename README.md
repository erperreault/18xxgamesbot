18xx.games Bot - A friendly Discord chatbot
======================================================

- Core code is in `server.py`
- Store your Discord bot token in `.env` as `TOKEN = "thisisthetoken"`
- Requirements go in `requirements.txt`

Features to be implemented can be found under Issues > Enhancements. If you'd like to contribute please open Issues and make Pull Requests.

To run this bot yourself, first ensure you meet all requirements in `requirements.txt`. From there it's sufficient to `git clone` this repository and use the included procfile if deploying on Heroku. Heroku's free plan allows 24/7 uptime for a bot such as this one. Note that Heroku's included PostgreSQL support must be [configured separately](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).
