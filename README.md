* Ensure you have installed the requirements in `requirements.txt`, then `git clone` this repository.
* Register a bot account and generate a token following [Discord's guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) - store the token in `.env` as `TOKEN = "thisisthetoken"`. 
* Use the included procfile if deploying on Heroku. Heroku's free plan allows 24/7 uptime for a bot such as this one. Note that Heroku's included PostgreSQL support must be [configured separately](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).
